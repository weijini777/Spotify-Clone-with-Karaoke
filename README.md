# Spotify Clone with Karaoke
Do you ever want to karoke with your friends while listening to spotify?

## Goal:
Create a Spotify-esque application that connects you and a friend so you guys can jam to songs together.

## How it is built:
* The application is built with react, and uses the Spotify Web API to retreive data from your actual spotify account
* Uses the Spotify Web SDK to control real time playback of music (Working on switching to the new Spotify Connect Web API)
* Connecting video streams using WebRTC (still in progress)
